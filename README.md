# Web Usage Mining

## Problem Statement
Web usage mining, employing data mining techniques, endeavors to uncover usage patterns within the vast landscape of web data, with the goal of understanding and enhancing web-based applications. 
However, the escalating complexity of user behavior in the face of expanding data poses a challenge. Existing methods often fall short in efficiently distilling meaningful insights, leading to a noticeable gap between user expectations and the functionality of web applications. 
Additionally, the absence of standardized practices hampers the seamless integration of these insights into application improvement processes. 
This project aims to address these challenges by developing innovative solutions that enhance the scalability, efficiency, and accuracy of web usage mining techniques and streamline their integration for optimal application enhancement.
